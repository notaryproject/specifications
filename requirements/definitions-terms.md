## Artifact / Image

Artifacts are a generalization of how images are stored in an instance of the [OCI Distribution Spec][oci-distribution-spec].
An [OCI Image][oci-image] is a type of [OCI Artifact][oci-artifact].
When referencing artifacts, within a [fully qualified reference](#registry-fully-qualified-reference), the artifact is right most element of the namespace, combined with the `:tag`.
Reference: [OCI Artifacts][oci-artifact]

## Fingerprint

A short identifier of a given public key.
Reference: [Fingerprint][fingerprint]

## OCI Annotations

A key-value map that can be associated with [OCI Descriptors][oci-descriptor] and [OCI Image manifests][oci-manifest].
OCI spec reference: [OCI Annotations][oci-annotations]

## OCI Descriptor

A structure describing content, including the media type, a content-addressable digest, the size, and other properties.
Descriptors are used to describe layers and configuration in a manifest.
OCI spec reference: [OCI Descriptor][oci-descriptor]

## OCI Index

A higher-level collection of [image manifests][oci-manifest], or other [oci indexes][oci-index], typically used to describe platform-specific (architecture and operating-system) images that can be identified collectively and referred to together.
The specific image manifests are identified by modified [descriptors][oci-descriptor] with additional properties and restrictions.
[OCI Artifacts][oci-artifact] are another use-case for indexes where an OCI Index can reference a collection of artifacts, such as an image, a deployment chart, its SBoM and deployment configuration references.
OCI spec reference: [OCI Image Index][oci-index]

## OCI Manifest

A description of an [artifact][oci-artifact].
The manifest references optional configuration and blobs (layers) as content-addressable references ([descriptors][oci-descriptor]).
Artifacts may be container images, helm charts or other artifact types that may be signed and stored in a registry.
OCI spec reference: [OCI Image Manifest][oci-manifest]

## Registry

A registry is a collection of [OCI Indexes][oci-index] and [OCI Manifests][oci-manifest] for a specific org or entity.
A unique registry may be uniquely identified with a domain or a root namespace:  
![registry name](/media/unique-registry-domain-ref.png)
![registry and namespace](/media/unique-registry-namespace-ref.png)

## Repo/Repository

A repo/repository refers to the unique location, within a registry.
When referring to a repo, the registry is assumed, based on the context.
![registry and repository](/media/registry-repo-ref.png)

## Repository Path

A path, within the [unique registry org](#multi-tenant-registry), up to, but not including the repository (repo) name.
![repository path](/media/registry-namespace-ref.png)

## Registry: Fully Qualified Reference

In order to deploy an artifact, a fully qualified reference is required.
This includes the unique registry, namespace, repo and tag.
![fully qualified reference](/media/fully-qualified-artifact-ref.png)

## SBoM

Represents a generic, non-project specific, reference to a Software Bill of Materials.
Similar to the automotive industry which tracks the components that make up a vehicle, the SBoM may contain the list of packages used within the artifact, the compiler and version used to build the artifact and other relevant information.
Additional reference: [Software bill of materials][sbom]

## Subject

The data that is signed.

## Tag

Information that represents a version, or platform specific version of the artifact.
E.g.:

- `example.com/org/namespace/artifact:tag`
- `org.example.com/namespace/artifact:tag`
- `org.example.com/databases/somedb:v1` (multi-arch tag)
- `org.example.com/databases/somedb:v1-alpine` (platform specific tag)
- `org.example.com/databases/somedb:v1-windows` (platform specific tag)
- `org.example.com/databases/somedb:v1-helm` (helm chart to deploy a platform specific image)
