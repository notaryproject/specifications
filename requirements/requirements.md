## Goals

Notary v2 aims to address the learnings and gaps of v1, while prioritizing a set of goals and [scenarios](./scenarios.md).

1. Offline signature creation
1. Signatures attesting to authenticity and/or certification
1. Maintain the original artifact digest and collection of associated tags, supporting existing dev through deployment workflows
1. Multiple signatures per artifact, enabling the originating vendor signature, public registry certification and user/environment signatures
1. Native persistance within an [OCI Artifact][oci-artifacts] enabled, [distribution-spec][distribution-spec] based registry
1. Artifact and signature copying within and across [OCI Artifact][oci-artifacts] enabled, [distribution-spec][distribution-spec] based registries
1. Support multi-tenant registries enabling cloud providers and enterprises to support managed services at scale
1. Support private registries, where public content may be copied to, and new content originated within
1. Air-gapped environments, where the originating registry of content is not accessible
1. Key hierarchies and delegation
1. Key revocation, including private and air-gapped registries
1. Key acquisition must support users from hobbyists, open source projects to large software vendors
1. Usable workflows, enabled for the masses to easily create and consume Notary v2 signatures

## Non Goals

1. Trust on first use
1. Implicit permissions on rotated keys
1. Compatibility with Notary v1

## Key Stake Holders & Contributors
