# Notation Threat Model

## Overview

Notation is a comprehensive tool for generating and verifying signatures associated with software artifacts. Its purpose is to validate the integrity and authenticity, accomplishing this through the implementation of fine-grained policies.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture and components.

![Notation system overview](../media/notation-system.svg)

- **User**: The actor could be a signer or a verifier. A signer interacts with Notation CLI to sign artifacts. A verifier interacts with Notation CLI to verify artifacts against signatures.
- **Artifact Builder**: The actor who is responsible for producing software artifacts using build systems. Notation supports signing and verification of software artifacts including but are not limited to container images, helm charts, SBOM (Software Bill of Materials). These artifacts can be stored either in remote registries or locally on disk using [OCI image layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.0/image-layout.md).
  - Artifact in registries: Take container images as an example, users can use `docker` commands to produce container images, and store them to a registry. A container image in a registry can be referenced by a fully qualified path, for example `registry.wabbit-networks.io/net-monitor@sha256:xxx`. SBOM is another example, which are generated by tools during build process, stored as OCI artifacts in OCI-compliant registries, and referenced by a fully qualified path as well.
  - Artifact as OCI image layout: OCI image layout is a directory structure that contains files and folders that refer to an OCI image. See [OCI image layout spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.0/image-layout.md) for details.
- **File System**: The file system where Notation or application built with Notation library is installed. For Notation signing artifacts as OCI image layout, it is the place where artifacts and associated signatures are stored. File system is within Notation trust boundary. Users or organizations should follow the security best practices to ensure the file system is safe to be used before proceeding any Notation commands. There are different directories and files as follows:
  - Notation config file, where general configuration is stored
  - Notation trust policy file, where trust policy configuration is stored
  - Notation trust store, where certificate files are stored to validate signatures
  - Notation plugin directory, where Notation plugins are installed
  - Credential store, where the registry or Key management credentials are stored
- **Notation Plugin**: An external component/binary that can integrate as one of the steps in Notationâ€™s workflow for signature generation or verification, see [plugin spec](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/v1.0.0-rc.2/specs/plugin-extensibility.md) for details.
- **Registry**: A registry stores container images as well as related content formats, such as Helm charts, OCI artifacts built to the OCI image format specification. Registries are outside Notation trust boundary.
- **KMS**: A Key Management System that supports the generation and management of signing material such as certificates (along with private key) management or a signing service. KMS are outside Notation trust boundary.
- **OCSP Responder**: The [Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6960) is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate. Notation uses OCSP to check the certificate's revocation status.

## Notation sign artifacts using remote key

### Data flow

A signer uses Notation to sign the artifacts and store signatures either locally on the disk or in a registry.

The following diagram illustrates Notation signing artifacts stored in registries with keys stored in KMS:

The following diagram illustrates Notation signing artifacts as OCI image layout with keys stored in KMS:

![Notation signs artifacts as OCI image layout in the filesystem](../media/notation-sign-local.svg)

As per the [Notary Project signature specification](../specs/signature-specification.md), the signature payload is a JSON document which requires the [OCI descriptor](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.0/descriptor.md) of the target artifact. For artifacts stored in a registry, the descriptor info can be retrieved from [image manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0-rc2/manifest.md) stored in the registry. For artifacts stored as an [OCI Image layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.0/image-layout.md), the descriptor info can be retrieved by inspecting the `index.json` file of OCI Image layout.

### Threats and Mitigation

|   Title                      | STRIDE threat type     | Threat Status | Priority | Entity          | Description   | Mitigation   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Compromised signing key      | Information disclosure | Mitigated     | High     | Signer          | Signing keys are compromised, and this may lead to arbitrary artifacts being signed by attackers | Users store the signing keys in hardware security module (HSM) and rotate them periodically. In case a signing key is compromised, users must rotate the signing key, and revoke associated certificates.  |
| Inaccessible Registry        | Denial of Service      | Mitigated     | High     | Registry        | Registry is not able to service incoming requests or perform up to spec, thus users are unable to publish any artifacts | Notation supports verification of signatures stored locally |
| Serving tampered artifacts   | Tampering              | Mitigated     | High     | Registry        | Data stored in registries are tampered, this may lead to malicious artifacts being signed | Notation signs artifacts stored in local file system, and stores signatures locally or in the registry |
| Disclosure of signature info | Information disclosure | Mitigated     | High     | Registry        | Attackers eavesdrop on registries, this may lead to the disclosure of sensitive signature info | Notation interacts with trusted registries via TLS or signs artifacts stored in local file system, and then stores signatures locally |
| Tampered files               | Tampering              | Mitigated     | High     | File System     | Files read by Notation are tampered, this may lead to failure of notation sign operation | Notation must be installed on secure and trusted infrastructure|
| Disclosure of files          | Information disclosure | Mitigated     | High     | File System     | Files are accessed by attackers, this may lead to disclosure of notation config files and credential files | Notation is installed in trusted infrastructure with right file permissions. Notation stores the credentials securely using credential store. Notation interacts with notation plugin to access signing keys via remote KMS or a HSM device |
| Malicious plugin             | Tampering              | Mitigated     | High     | Notation Plugin | A malicious plugin is installed, this may lead to arbitrary code being executed by attackers | Verify the integrity and authenticity of the plugin before using the plugin |

## Notation verify artifacts against signatures

### Data flow

A verifier uses Notation to verify artifacts against signatures stored in the file system or in a registry to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the artifacts before deploying the artifacts.

The following diagram illustrates Notation verifying artifacts stored in a registry:

![Notation verifies artifacts stored in registries](../media/notation-verify-remote.svg)

The following diagram illustrates Notation verifying artifacts stored in a registry with a verification plugin:

![Notation verifies artifacts stored in registries using verification plugin](../media/notation-verify-plugin.svg)

The following diagram illustrates Notation verifying artifacts stored as OCI image layout in the file system:

![Notation verifies artifacts as OCI image layout in the filesystem](../media/notation-verify-local.svg)

The certificates trusted by the verifier are stored in Notation trust store in the file system. Users can download the certificates from KMS or request CA vendor for CA certificates.

### Threats and Mitigation

|   Title                      | STRIDE threat type     | Threat Status | Priority | Entity          | Description   | Mitigation   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Inaccessible Registry        | Denial of Service      | Mitigated     | High     | Registry        | Registry is not able to service incoming requests or perform up to spec, thus users are unable to verify artifacts | Notation supports verification of signatures stored locally |
| Serving tampered artifacts   | Tampering              | Mitigated     | High     | Registry        | Data stored in registries are tampered, this may lead to malicious artifacts being consumed | Notation verifies the digest specified by the user and the digest store in the signature are the same. Notation does support verification using tag but its highly discouraged by emitting a warning |
| Disclosure of signature info | Information disclosure | Mitigated     | High     | Registry        | Attackers eavesdrop on registries, this may lead to the disclosure of sensitive signature info | Notation interacts with trusted registries via TLS by default or Notation signs artifacts stored in local file system, and then stores signatures locally |
| Tampered files               | Tampering              | Mitigated     | High     | File System      | Files read by Notation are tampered, this may lead to failure of notation verify operation or verification bypassed | Notation is installed in trusted infrastructure with right file permissions |
| Disclosure of files          | Information disclosure | Mitigated     | High     | File System      | Files are accessed by attackers, this may lead to disclosure of notation config files and credential files | Notation is installed in trusted infrastructure with right file permissions. Notation stores the credentials securely using credential store |
| Malicious plugin             | Tampering              | Mitigated     | High     | Notation Plugin | A malicious plugin is installed, this may lead to arbitrary code being executed by attackers | Verify plugin package before installation or plugin is installed by authorized users |
| Inaccessible OCSP Responder  | Denial of Service      | Not Mitigated     | High     | OCSP Responder  | OCSP Responder is not able to service incoming requests or perform up to spec, thus users are unable to validate certificate revocation status | It cannot be mitigated, since revocation status should be retrieved from OCSP responder, which requires network access. Notation verification should fail if revocation check is configured as `enforced` and OCSP responder is inaccessible. Users can configure trust policy to log or skip revocation check if OCSP responder is not reliable. |
